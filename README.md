# Income_Limit_Prediction
Create a machine learning model to predict whether an individual earns above or below a certain amount.

# About
It classifies people into above or below income limit based on various paramaters like age, occupation, gender to name a few.

# Objective
Aiming an efficient and simplified coding, I tried to use the most efficient models (catboost) and Auto libraries (autoviz)

Please feel to suggest code improvisations as I am a deep believer of co-learning by doing
